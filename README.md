### Instructions

To run this program we use a few external packages so we are using Python Poetry to manage it.

To install Poetry visit: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation


Once installed, download this repository to any local folder.

Open a Terminal and navigate to the repository.

Within the repository install the dependencies with:  `poetry install`

To run the program you need:

```
poetry run clean_excel/clean.py <full path of your excel file>
```

Once the program completes, you should be able to find a cleaned excel where the original file was.
